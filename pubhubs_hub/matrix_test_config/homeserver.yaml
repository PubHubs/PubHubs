# Default settings for the PubHubs Synapse Homeserver
#
# This file serves both as an example to hub administrators that are
# configuring their hub and as the default settings for a testhub
# running locally in a development setup.
#
# This dual purpose ensures the documentation does not get outdated.
#
#
# PUBHUBS SPECIFIC SETTINGS
#
# Some settings below are necessary for the correct and secure functioning
# of your PubHubs hub, and should not be changed.  This is indicated with a "DON'T CHANGE" below.
#
# To ensure these "DON'T CHANGE" settings are set correctly, a special 'ConfigChecker' module
# will crash Synapse when it detects any malconfiguration, and will explain the problem and solution
# in the hub's log.  This should also help you update your configuration file after pulling a new
# version of the hub container.  It's therefore not advisable to automatically pull new versions
# of the hub image.
#
# While some settings shouldn't be changed, others should (especially secrets).  This is indicated
# with a "DO CHANGE".  The 'ConfigChecker' does check whether you've changed them (when the
# public_baseurl starts with "https"), but doesn't check whether you've changed them to
# something sensible.
#
#
# NOTE TO PUBHUBS DEVELOPERS
#
# If you change anything here, please realise these changes are not distributed automatically to the hubs,
# so consider updating the 'ConfigChecker' module in modules/pubhubs/config_checker.py.
#
modules:
  - module: conf.modules.config_checker.ConfigChecker  # DON'T CHANGE
    config: {
      ## DEVELOPERS: by default the ConfigChecker will check whether the 'DO CHANGE' fields
      ## have been changed when the public_baseurl starts with 'https', and otherwise it will
      ## check that they *haven't* been changed (to make sure that the check-code is up-to-date
      ## with the current defaults.)
      ##
      ## HUB ADMINISTRATORS: please only use 'yes_should_be_changed'
      ##
      ## You can override this behaviour with the following field.
      # check_do_change_fields: yes_should_be_changed   # check that 'DO CHANGE' fields have been changed
      # check_do_change_fields: yes_should_be_unchanged # check that 'DO CHANGE' fields haven't been changed
      # check_do_change_fields: 'no'                    # don't check 'DO CHANGE' fields at all
