# PubHubs — Public hubs for community networks

PubHubs (Public Hubs) is a Dutch community network platform built on public values: openness, transparency, data-minimisation and collective stewardship. It connects people across local hubs (i.e. neighbourhoods, sports clubs, schools, museums, patient organisations, libraries, municipalities) while protecting participants’ data and enabling trustworthy communication — with cryptographic attestation where appropriate.

> Designed for the commons: cooperation, decentral responsibility and practical solidarity are core design goals.

# Current status

This project is **in active development** and moving through test phases. The repository is a mirror of internal work and many internals may change before a stable release. If you or your organisation want to help test or contribute, contact the team first.

## Architecture

- **PubHubs central** — Central authentication and identity management (issues pseudonyms to hubs). Implemented in Rust.
- **Global client** — Web client that navigates between hubs (embeds hub clients via iframe). Implemented in TypeScript + Vue.
- **Hub servers** — Customised Matrix homeservers (based on Synapse) extended with PubHubs Python modules; by default hubs are not federated inside PubHubs.
- **Hub clients** — Matrix-based clients embedded in the Global Client with PubHubs-specific features (secured rooms, attribute-based access). Implemented in TypeScript + Vue.
- **Identity / attributes** — Handled by [Yivi](https://yivi.app) (used for login and attribute-based access).

> [!Warning] Placement note
> Do not place this repository inside a folder managed by home-manager’s impermanence feature — that can cause permission problems for test hub data and local services.

## Developer quickstart

### 1. Reproducible development shell using `Nix flake`

Use the flake to start a reproducible dev shell:

```sh
nix develop
# Or, with direnv enabled:
direnv allow
```

See flake.nix for the exact packages and toolchain the project uses.

### 2. Shell helper using `Mask`

[Mask](https://github.com/jacobdeichert/mask) is included in the flake, but you can also install it globally.

```sh
# Run a task defined in maskfile.md
mask <task> # e.g. `mask run yivi`
```

## Values & governance

PubHubs is explicitly designed around public-value principles: collective control, privacy by default, transparency, and practical solidarity. Technical choices favor community agency and resist concentration of control in opaque or commercial systems.
