# Hub API

Here you will find api calls to the hub's server that are not standard Matrix Api calls, but specific for PubHubs clients.

## General

### Endpoints

#### `GET _synapse/client/.ph/info`

Unauthenticated (on purpose). Rerturns basic info about the hub, currenly only the hub version, e.g.:
```json
{"hub_version": "v0.5.1-34-g1f07cbb7"}
```
Will be used more extensively by the upcoming multi-server setup.

 - `hub_version`:  what `git describe --tags` returned when the hub's docker image was built

## Secured rooms

### Goal of YiviRoomJoiner module

Certain rooms will only be accessible after disclosing certain attributes in Yivi, this module makes that possible.

The rooms and the attributes are configured through the secured rooms endpoint on `/_synapse/client/secured_rooms`.

### Requirements

One extra settings in homeserver.yaml is required to make the module work:
- `public_baseurl` needs to be set to something publicly reachable if you want to be able to use the proxied Yivi service. Unless your phone will reach the synapse server on the default public baseurl

As in all matrix settings with docker on mac 'host.docker.internal' works on linux replace with: '172.17.0.1'

### Endpoints

These endpoints are only accessible with a standard access token used by Synapse, only admins are authorised.

#### `GET /_synapse/client/secured_rooms`

Will return a list of all secured rooms with their settings.

**Errors** Returns -
- `401 Forbidden` if no token or a non-admin is provided.

#### `POST /_synapse/client/secured_rooms`

Create a new secured room. Example request body:

```json
{
	"name": "new secured room",
    "topic":"topic",
	"accepted": {
		"pbdf.sidn-pbdf.email.domain": {
			"accepted_values": [
				"ru.nl"
			],
			"profile": true
		}
	},
	"user_txt": "usertx",
	"expiration_time_days": 10,
	"type": "ph.messages.restricted"
}
```

`name` is the name of the room.

`topic` is a description of the room.

`accepted` is an object where the keys are Yivi attributes and the values are objects themselves with two keys:
- `accepted_values` is a list of allowed attribute values, if the list is empty all values are allowed.
- `profile` is a boolean whether other participants in the room will see the particular disclosed attribute values.

`user_txt` is some text that can explain to users about what to disclose. This is unused so far.

`expiration_time_days` is the number of days for the secured room to expire. Default valie is 90 days.

`type` is the type of the room to create, for now 2 values are supported "ph.messages.restricted" (regular chat room)
and "ph.threaded.restricted" (a more forum-like room).

Accepted Yivi attributes can be find here: https://github.com/privacybydesign/pbdf-schememanager


Will return the created room including a room id.

**Errors** Returns -
- `401 Forbidden` if no token or a non-admin is provided.
- `400 Bad Request` with a body of errors if the request body is malformed.

#### `PUT /_synapse/client/secured_rooms`

Update a room with, for example:

```json
{
    "name": "updated name",
    "topic": "updated topic",
	"accepted": {
		"pbdf.sidn-pbdf.email.domain": {
			"accepted_values": [
				"ru.nl"
			],
			"profile": true
		}
	},
	"user_txt": "usertx",
	"expiration_time_days": 10,
	"room_id": "!pVEtaikxFiGHXPbFOn:testhub.matrix.host",
	"type": "ph.messages.restricted"

}
```

Returns the id of the updated room:
```json
{
	"modified": "!pVEtaikxFiGHXPbFOn:testhub.matrix.host"
}
```

**Errors** Returns -
- `401 Forbidden` if no token or a non-admin is provided.
- `400 Bad Request` with a body of errors if the request body is malformed or the room cannot be matched.

#### `DELETE /_synapse/client/secured_rooms?room_id=<room_id>`

Delete a room including the matrix room, by removing all the users.

```json
{
	"deleted": "!pVEtaikxFiGHXPbFOn:testhub.matrix.host"
}
```

**Errors** Returns -
- `401 Forbidden` if no token or a non-admin is provided.

#### `GET /_synapse/client/ph/yivi-endpoint/start` and `GET /_synapse/client/ph/yivi-endpoint/result`

The generic Yivi endpoints to use to get the session to the front end. See for an example: https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma-frontend-packages

#### `/_synapse/client/yiviproxy`

Allow the front end session to check the session status.

### Used endpoints by this module

- /_synapse/client/ph/yivi-endpoint
- /_synapse/client/yiviproxy
- /_synapse/client/secured_rooms
