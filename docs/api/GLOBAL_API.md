This file describes some of the HTTP end-points used by PubHubs central.

# Bar endpoints
The following endpoints are to be used by the bar.

**Authentication** The bar (which if for now integrated in the global client) relies for authentication on the cookies set by PubHubs Central after the end-user logs in. (*NB:* the `GET /bar/hubs` requires no authentication of the user.)

## Bar state
To allow the hub-selection-bar to have the same appearance accross different devices, we allow the bar to store and retrieve some state from PubHubs Central, using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).  Currently, this will probably be a JSON-file, but in the future, we might want to consider encrypting this, so that PubHubs Central cannot inspect it.  (The problem here is how to move the user's encryption key between devices.)  Anyway, to PubHubs Central, this 'bar state' is some opaque `application/octet-stream`.


### `GET /bar/state`
Returns `200 Ok` with as body the current bar state for the present user (according to the `PHAccount` cookie). Includes an `ETag` header with an [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) for the current state (being the lowercase-hex encoding of the `sha256` of the current bar state enclosed by two double quotes, `"`.)

If the bar state has not previously been set, it will be the empty byte string, with `ETag: "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"`.

**Errors** Returns `403 Forbidden` when no valid `PHAccount` cookie was provided.

### `PUT /bar/state`
Changes the current bar state for the present user to the body of the request, provided that an [`If-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Match)-header is send along with the current (and soon to be old) bar state ETag (obtained by a previous `GET /bar/state`, or `PUT /bar/state`.)  A `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`-header must also be added.

Return `204 No Content` upon success, with empty body, but including the new ETag via the `ETag`-header.

**Errors**  Returns - 
 - `403 Forbidden` when no valid `PHAccount` cookie was provided.
 - `400 Bad Request` when: 
   - No `If-Match` with a single ETag was provided; or
   - `Content-Type` was not set to  `application/octet-stream`;
 - `412 Precondition Failed` when the ETag from `If-Match` did not match the ETag of the current bar state.  This is to prevent the bar from accidentally overriding previous changes made from a different device.  

## Hubs
### `GET /bar/hubs`
Returns `200 Ok` with an `application/json` body consisting of an array of objects (one for each hub) with the following fields.
 - `name`;
 - `description`;
 - `client_uri`, the Hub's client location, to be loaded in an iframe of the global client.

# PubHubs session cookies
Pubhubs Central uses ~three~ two cookies to keep track of sessions.  These cookies are always set together and deleted together.  We use two cookies—and not just one—because for different purposes we need different `SameSite` settings. See the [`Set-Cookie` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) for details on  `SameSite` (and `HttpOnly`).
 - `PHAccount` is the default cookie for authentication towards PubHubs Central, it is `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` and `HttpOnly`.
 - `PHAccount.CrossSite` is used during the hub login flow where the end-user is temporarily redirected from the hub to PHC to be authenticated, and where because of this redirect the `PHAccount` (being `SameSite=Strict`) is not available.  The `PHAccount.CrossSite` cookie is `Secure`, `SameSite=None` and `HttpOnly`.  (It is not `SameSite=Lax` because historically the login flow happens within an `iframe`, but currently is toplevel.)

The `PHAccount` and `PHAccount.CrossSite` cookies have the following format.
```
base64urlunpadded(user_id + "." + created + "." + until + "." + TAG))
```
where:
 - `base64urlunpadded(x)` represents the urlsafe base64-encoding (so using the digits `A`, ..., `Z`, `a`, ..., `z`, `0`, ..., `9`, `-`, `_`) of `x` without padding (so no trailing `=` or `==`); 
 - `user_id`:  the user id (an opaque identifier that does not contain a `.`);
 - `created`: the timestamp (number of seconds since 1970 in UTC) of the creation of this cookie, written in decimal notation;
 - `until`: the timestamp of expiry of this cookie, in decimal;
 - `TAG`: the hex-encoded SHA-256 HMAC of `user_id + "." + created + "." + until` with `cookie_secret` as key.


### Example
Consider:
```
My4xNjg3NTIzMjA0LjE2OTAxMTUyMDQuN0IwMTI5QjFFNDQ0MDdFRDRBMDAyMkE0NUMzRUQxNkREQUYwQTdENjVDQTBCRUJFNEFERTk4MzIxNTk0MEE1NA
```
This is the urlsafe base64 unpadded encoding of:
```
3.1687523204.1690115204.7B0129B1E44407ED4A0022A45C3ED16DDAF0A7D65CA0BEBE4ADE983215940A54
```
So:
 - `user_id` is `3`;
 - the cookie was created at 14:26:44 on 2023-06-23, CEST;
 - the cookie expires at 14:26:44 on 2023-07-23, CEST;
 - the `cookie_secret` is `default_cookie_secret` as can be verified with the following python3 code
   ```
   import hmac
   hmac.digest(b"default_cookie_secret", b"3.1687523204.1690115204","sha256").hex()
   '7b0129b1e44407ed4a0022a45c3ed16ddaf0a7d65ca0bebe4ade983215940a54'
   ```
