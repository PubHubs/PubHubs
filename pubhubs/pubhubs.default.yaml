# PubHubs configuration
#
# The default configuration suitable for local development can be found in the "pubhubs.default.yaml" file
# Please do not change that file yourself, but instead make a copy called "pubhubs.yaml", and modify tbat.
# (This prevents you from accidentally committing your local configuration changes to the repository.)
# 
# Currently, the integration tests in the `tests` directory also derive their configuration from
# the "pubhubs.default.yaml" file, but we might change this in the future.

    # WARNINGs:
    # 
    #  - Never remove a hub name, because that will break links;  only add names.
    #    The first name is the one that's used by default.  (So, to 'change' a hub's name,
    #    just add the new name to the front of the list of names.)
    #
    #  - Never change the `id` of a hub because the users' pseudonyms are derived from it.
    - names: [testhub, testhub_alias]
      description: This is the default testhub for local development

      # NOTE: To generate a new `id`, use `cargo run tools generate-hubid`
