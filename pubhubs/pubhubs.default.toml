# PubHubs configuration
#
# The default configuration suitable for local development can be found in the "pubhubs.default.toml" file
# Please do not change that file yourself, but instead make a copy called "pubhubs.toml", and modify that.
# (This prevents you from accidentally committing your local configuration changes to the repository.)
# 
# Currently, the integration tests in the `tests` directory also derive their configuration from
# the "pubhubs.default.toml" file, but we might change this in the future.
#
# For a quick explanation of the TOML file format, see see https://toml.io

# WARNINGs:
# 
#  - Never remove a hub handle, because that will break links;  only add handles.
#    The first handle is the one that's used by default.  (So, to 'change' a hub's handle,
#    just add the new handle to the front of the list of handles.)
#
#  - Never change the `id` of a hub because the users' pseudonyms are derived from it.
