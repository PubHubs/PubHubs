You can use Yivi to log into several websites and make yourself known there.\n\nTo use Yivi, you first have to add data about yourself in the app. It is explained in the app how to do this. For more information, see the website {hyperlink}. To use Yivi for PubHubs, you have to add an email address and phone number in the app.',
